                <p>
                  The MyHeel smart insoles were developed in 2021 by a team of three Design Computing students at the University of Sydney. Our objective was to create a podiatric solution for users at risk of developing foot-related problems that considers the needs of the wearer, healthcare professionals and the environment. Our vision was to transform the user experience of people monitoring their feet by making it easier, more accessible and engaging for MyHeel smart insole wearers to get in touch with their feet.
                  <br><br>
                  The MyHeel smart insoles stand apart from other smart insoles on the market because they are biodegradable (with reusable microbits) and they consider the needs of both the user and health care professionals who may be assisting the wearer. The MyHeel insoles connect to a user-friendly, interactive application that provides information about the wearer’s foot health, which can be relayed to their healthcare professional. The insoles also prompt the wearer to engage in interactive foot exercises - either independently or facilitated by a healthcare professional. 
                  <br><br>
                  Potentially, the MyHeel smart insoles could be made available to a range of people including those in countries where health care equipment is not readily accessible. This would help to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all people at all ages by 2030 (United Nations, 2016). Evidently, the dynamic team of designers behind the MyHeel smart insoles have developed a burgeoning interest in the sphere of Biodesign and the future of healthcare. In future, they hope to pursue more interdisciplinary projects that merge biology and design to help address major global challenges.
